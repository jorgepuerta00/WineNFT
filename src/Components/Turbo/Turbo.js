                It’s as simple as this: The more NFTs the more Tokens! With

                you can use to play games, trade or buy more NFTs, or enjoy

                  The ledgerlegends.racing Token TURBO will be deeply tied into
                  the game’s ecosystem. TURBO will eventually become
                  deflationary and players/holders will be incentivized to hold,
                  causing natural price growth, this will be achieved in the
                  following ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                  TURBO will be required as the primary form of in-game
                  currency. Players will need TURBO to pay for Ingame Upgrades,
                  game fees, Marketplace purchases, and more. Additionally, the
                  “TURBO Treasury” will eventually buy and burn TURBO, making it
                  naturally deflationary as the ecosystem grows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TURBO will eventually provide holders with the opportunity to
                  actively participate in the future directions of the game! The
                  project will slowly and safely shift from an initial structure
                  to a fully decentralized online game. TURBO holders will be
                  able to participate in governance voting in the future as part
                  of an upcoming DAO/DAC, allowing them to shape the future of
                  ledgerlegends.racing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The maximum supply of TURBO is 500,000,000, while only 10%
                  (50,000,000) was initially circulated. 1 TURBO is equal to 100
                  DROPS. The initial market cap listing price was $0.01. TURBO
                  is already listed at <span>Quickswap</span> – but it is
                  planned to be listed at other Exchanges in the future (e.g.
                  KUKOIN). In addition, TURBO will be listed at coinmarketcap.
