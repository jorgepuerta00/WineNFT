              Collection
            </p>
            <p>
              The second phase was launched on January 3rd. And because it’s so
              much fun, we published a second pre-launch game right away: the
              ledgerlegends.racing Slot Machine! ✅
            </p>
            <p>
              The game is based on a classic slot machine. Push the lever and
              watch three cards spin. With a little luck you will have three of
              the same! Just play and win more NFT’s every day!
            </p>

                -For only 9 ETH you can get more packs containing 5 cards of our
                NFT collection or one of our exclusive „Silver Collection“! The
                Silver Collection adds some even stronger and faster cars to the
                game. There are a few real gems among them.

            <p>
              In the third phase we have further expanded our website and our
              features. Most important news: the account section now shows the
              personal garage and thus provides a good overview of all NFTs in
              one’s possession and which ones are missing in the respective
              category. ✅
            </p>
            <p className="mt-1">
              The garage will be an important part of the soon to follow Main
              Game. And collecting them makes even more sense: the more
              categories that are completed, the more Superfast Tokens may be
              claimed!

            <ul>
              <li>
                - We implemented our original website in no time during the last
                Christmas season and didn’t have much time for good design and
                features – after all, we needed all the design capacity in the
                creation of our ledgerlegends.racing Collections. But that has
                finally changed: the new website is finally there (and you are
                just looking at it).

            <p>
              The waiting was over in March! The Superfast Token TURBO finally
              came into play! TURBO is the substance that moves our game
              forward. ✅
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s as simple as this: The more NFTs the more Tokens! With every
              NFT you buy, you receive a certain amount of TURBO that you can
              use to play games, trade or buy more NFTs, or enjoy other benefits
              within the game. Every early NFT holder has received a decent
              amount of TURBO at launch! The more NFTs the more tokens. Silver
              Collection NFT- Holders even received a multiple of tokens. ✅
            </p>
            <p>
              In preparation and anticipation for the launch of the Quartet
              Game, we have expanded our NFT selection with two exclusive
              Collections: the very rare and limited to a few vehicles Rose Gold
              Collection and the noblest, fastest and strongest cards yet in the
              also strictly limited Carbon and Leather Collection. ✅

              the Quartet Game (Play for Fun) and let the community compete
              against the AI with their own cards – as the name suggests,
              however, for the time being only for fun. A good opportunity to

              The more difficult the game selection, the more TURBO there is to
              earn – in total, each player will be able to earn up to 100,000
              TURBO per day. Not so bad, is it? ✅

                - Sometime in mid-June, we plan to finish the testing phase and
                go live with Play-to-earn. From then on, every player can earn a
                small fortune in TURBO with their cards – completely risk-free
                and free of charge for the time being.
              </li>
              <li className="">
                - It’s time to expand the community and invite more people to
                our Discord and to our game! Therefore, at the end of
                June/beginning of July we will launch a major campaign via
                youTube and various other social media channels and look forward
                to seeing the family grow!

              Phase 8 is planned for late summer/ early fall this year and will

            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Play to Win is about exactly what the name suggests: winning! The
              game now enters a more professional phase, because from now on you
              can use all your skills and the best cards to get more cards. But
              beware: this time it’s serious! In play-to-win mode, you can not
              only win cards, but also lose them!
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              And another aspect will make this game mode exciting: the
              possibility to compete against human opponents – i.e. player
              against player! So from now on it will not only be possible to
              play against the AI but also concretely against other players.

                - And the most exciting thing is yet to come: we will start a
                raffle, where we will give away an exclusive sports car among
                our owners at regular intervals! Yes, you read correctly: no NFT
                and no toy but a real exclusive sports car! Each NFT is a
                winning ticket. The more NFT’s you have in your set, the greater
                your chance of winning. We cannot yet say when exactly the
                raffle will start. Anyway, this may not be possible before
                sometime in 2023.
